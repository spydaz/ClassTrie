# ClassTrie
Trie tree data structure for Letters; can be used for searching large strings for patterns or used to store many words inside 
Welcome to the ClassTrie wiki!


This creation Is the data trie.... A TREE....

In this issue the alphabet trie is created ; The strings are added by character with a STOP character at the end of the insert;

A Search function will be created ; to search the trie for words or search a string for words contained in the trie; ADDED

This method will be further extended to handle numerical inserts as well as DATA inserts for usage as a Conversation Trie;

I was searching for a method to combine various conversation trees; into a single tree; 

This will be it!

WORKING!!

Insert function 
FindPrefix function
FindWord Function 
CreateTrie Function 
ToString Function (displays contents of tree in report form)
ToView Function (displays Contents of Tree in TreeviewControl)


Saved as STRUCTURE; 

Note To extend This structure (just update the CharID to accomodate NewStringID, as well as Update ADD Function)

Probably the NodeID Pointer can be removed (Not Req)

Project build 1 was as class library (for Sharing)
Project build 2 was as EXE (for testing) 
Built With .net 4.52
