# Welcome to the ClassTrie wiki!

This creation Is the data trie.... A TREE....

In this issue the alphabet trie is created ; The strings are added by character with a STOP character at the end of the insert;

A Search function will be created ; to search the trie for words or search a string for words contained in the trie; ADDED

This method will be further extended to handle numerical inserts as well as DATA inserts for usage as a Conversation Trie;

I was searching for a method to combine various conversation trees; into a single tree; 

This will be it!

## WORKING!!

**Insert function;**

**FindPrefix function;**

**FindWord Function; **

**CreateTrie Function; **

**ToString Function (displays contents of tree in report form);**

**ToView Function (displays Contents of Tree in TreeviewControl);**



Saved as STRUCTURE; 

Note To extend This structure (just update the CharID to accomodate NewStringID, as well as Update ADD Function)

Probably the NodeID Pointer can be removed (Not Req)

_Project build 1 was as class library (for Sharing)_
_Project build 2 was as EXE (for testing) _
_Built With .net 4.52_

**02/06/2018
Updated Trie to Tree (Universal Tree)
Function ADD / Find Prefix / Find Word / CountWords / Count Node - StopChar nodes / Find Lowest Node - StopChar**

NEEDS - DELETE WORD CMD - 

**Universal Tree -**
 can also Hold Data at nodes using an Alphabetical Tree.....
To be Added.
 **(Input Data @ StopChar)(GetData From StopChar)**
Then Given a CharacterString Address (Data can be Added or Removed or located) Searching Should be done Via CharacterString (Not Data) or GetNode @ CharString Address (Edit/Remove)


**ADDED BINARY TREE**
POSTORDER / PREORDER TRAVERSAL / INSERT / CONTAINS 
**ADDED EXTENSIONS FOR TREENODE OPERATONS)**
